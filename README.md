Module 5 Challenge: Data Visualization using Matplotlib

Pymaceuticals Inc.
Project Overview: This project analyzes and provides actionable insights for strategic decision-making. The analysis leverages data from two main sources: mouse_metadata.csv and study_results.csv.

Using the matplotlib library, the analysis covers various aspects and communicates key findings, comparisons, and recommendations from the SCC Tumor Study.


Analysis Overview:
The SCC Tumor Study aimed to evaluate the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens. Approximately 250 mice were treated with various drug regimens, and tumor development was observed over a 45-day period.


Results
The SCC Tumor Study provides valuable insights into the efficacy of different treatment regimens. Capomulin and Ramicane stand out as potential leading treatments, warranting further exploration and clinical trials. The study's comprehensive analysis and visualizations offer a clear understanding of the treatment landscape, aiding informed decision-making for future research and development efforts.
